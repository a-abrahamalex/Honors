title: "FizzBuzz"
---

In a list consisting of elements from 1 to 100, numbers divisible by three were converted to Fizz, numbers divisible by five were converted to Buzz, and numbers divisible by both three and five were converted to FizzBuzz.

```{r}
listOfNumbers = c(1:100)

# These variables are the indexes of numbers that are divisible by three, five, and three and five
# If the remainder of the division is equal to zero, then the element in the list is divisible
divisibleByThree = which(listOfNumbers %% 3 == 0)
divisibleByFive = which(listOfNumbers %% 5 == 0)
divisibleByThreeAndFive = intersect(which(listOfNumbers %% 3 == 0), which(listOfNumbers %% 5 == 0))

# Converts the listOfNumbers into Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz
listOfNumbers[divisibleByThree] = "Fizz"
listOfNumbers[divisibleByFive] = "Buzz"
listOfNumbers[divisibleByThreeAndFive] = "FizzBuzz"

print(listOfNumbers)
```
